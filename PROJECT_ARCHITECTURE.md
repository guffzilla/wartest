# 🏗️ Warcraft Game Analysis System - Project Architecture

## **📋 Project Overview**
This is a comprehensive, enterprise-grade system for analyzing and managing Warcraft I, II, and III games. The system is designed to be modular, scalable, and future-proof, with support for local game analysis, multiplayer monitoring, and AI-powered insights.

## **🎯 Long-Term Vision**
- **Local Game Analysis**: Extract and analyze game assets, replays, and gameplay data
- **Multiplayer Monitoring**: Track and analyze multiplayer games across all three Warcraft titles
- **AI Integration**: Machine learning models for pattern recognition and game analysis
- **Tauri Desktop App**: Cross-platform application integrating all functionality
- **Database Integration**: PostgreSQL backend with Rust/Actix/SQLx framework
- **Cloud Deployment**: Scalable architecture for future cloud-based features
