# Wartest

A project for testing and development related to Warcraft games.

## Project Structure

- `games/` - Contains Warcraft I and II files (excluded from Git)
- `.gitignore` - Git ignore rules
- `README.md` - Project documentation

## Getting Started

This repository is set up to track your project files while excluding the large game data files in the `games/` folder.

## Development

Add your project files here and they will be tracked by Git. The `games/` folder is intentionally excluded to keep the repository size manageable.
