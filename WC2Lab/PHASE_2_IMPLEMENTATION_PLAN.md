pub async fn read_memory(&self, address: u64, size: usize) -> Result<Vec<u8>> {
    if let Some(handle) = self.process_handle {
        let mut buffer = vec![0u8; size];
        
        // Real memory reading using ReadProcessMemory
        let result = unsafe {
            ReadProcessMemory(
                handle,
                address as *const std::ffi::c_void,
                buffer.as_mut_ptr() as *mut std::ffi::c_void,
                size,
                std::ptr::null_mut()
            )
        };
        
        if result.is_ok() {
            Ok(buffer)
        } else {
            Err(anyhow!("Failed to read memory from 0x{:x}", address))
        }
    } else {
        Err(anyhow!("No process handle available"))
    }
}
```

#### Game State Parsing
```rust
// Parse actual game memory structures
pub async fn parse_game_state(&self, memory_data: &[u8]) -> Result<GameState> {
    // Implement real memory structure parsing
    // This will require reverse engineering the game's memory layout
    
    let mut game_state = GameState::default();
    
    // Parse unit information
    game_state.units = self.parse_units(memory_data)?;
    
    // Parse building information
    game_state.buildings = self.parse_buildings(memory_data)?;
    
    // Parse resource information
    game_state.resources = self.parse_resources(memory_data)?;
    
    Ok(game_state)
}
```

#### Performance Monitoring
```rust
// Add performance metrics collection
pub struct PerformanceMetrics {
    pub memory_read_time: Duration,
    pub ai_decision_time: Duration,
    pub input_execution_time: Duration,
    pub total_cycle_time: Duration,
    pub memory_usage: usize,
    pub cpu_usage: f64,
}

impl HeadlessGameEngine {
    pub async fn collect_performance_metrics(&self) -> PerformanceMetrics {
        // Implement real performance monitoring
        // Track timing, memory usage, CPU utilization
    }
