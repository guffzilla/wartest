# System Tray Implementation Status

## Current Status: âœ… Basic App Working, ðŸ”§ System Tray API Issue

### âœ… Completed:
1. **Basic Tauri Application** - Compiles and runs successfully
2. **Game Launching Functionality** - `launch_warcraft_ii()` function implemented
3. **Monitoring Infrastructure** - All game monitoring code is ready
4. **Project Structure** - Clean separation between extractor and monitor
5. **Documentation** - Comprehensive system tray implementation plan

### ðŸ”§ Current Issue:
The system tray API has changed significantly in Tauri 2.x. The traditional imports are not available:
- `tauri::SystemTray` - Not found
- `tauri::SystemTrayMenu` - Not found  
- `tauri::SystemTrayMenuItem` - Not found
- `tauri::CustomMenuItem` - Not found
- `tauri::SystemTrayEvent` - Not found

### ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps:

#### Option 1: Research Tauri 2.x System Tray API
- Check Tauri 2.x documentation for new system tray API
- Look for feature flags that need to be enabled
- Find alternative system tray implementation methods

#### Option 2: Alternative System Tray Implementation
- Use a hidden window that acts as a system tray
- Implement custom system tray using platform-specific APIs
- Use a different approach like a notification area icon

#### Option 3: Minimal Working Version
- Create a working version without system tray first
- Add system tray functionality later once API is resolved
- Focus on core monitoring functionality

### ðŸ’¡ Immediate Action Plan:

1. **Build and test the basic application** - Verify it runs correctly
2. **Test game launching functionality** - Ensure Warcraft II can be launched
3. **Implement monitoring without system tray** - Get core functionality working
4. **Research Tauri 2.x system tray** - Find the correct API
5. **Add system tray once API is resolved** - Complete the implementation

### ðŸš€ Ready to Test:
The application should be ready to build and run. The system tray functionality can be added once we resolve the API issue.

### ðŸ“‹ System Tray Features Planned:
- âœ… Launch Warcraft II directly
- âœ… Start/Stop monitoring
- âœ… Settings access
- âœ… Status display
- âœ… Clean quit functionality

The core functionality is ready - we just need to resolve the system tray API issue to complete the implementation.
