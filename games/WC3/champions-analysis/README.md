# W3Champions Analysis Project

## Overview
W3Champions is a competitive ladder system that integrates with Warcraft III, providing matchmaking, rankings, and enhanced gameplay features. This analysis project aims to understand the technology stack, architecture, and data structures used by W3Champions.

## Project Structure Analysis

### Main Components
- **W3Champions.exe** (51.4MB) - Main application executable
- **WIH.v1.1.1.w3c.exe** (248KB) - Warcraft III Integration Helper
- **index.html** (934B) - Web interface component
- **resources/** - Game assets and configuration files
  - **replaceabletextures/** - Custom game textures
    - **teamcolor/** - Team color textures
    - **teamglow/** - Team glow effects

## Technology Stack Analysis

### Frontend Technologies
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** - Web interface components
- **Custom UI Framework** - Likely Electron or similar for desktop app

### Backend Technologies
- **C++/C#** - Main executable (Windows PE format)
- **Warcraft III Integration** - Custom hooks and modifications
- **Network Communication** - Matchmaking and ladder services

### Game Integration
- **Warcraft III Modding** - Custom textures and assets
- **Memory Hooking** - Real-time game data extraction
- **Process Injection** - Integration with Warcraft III process
