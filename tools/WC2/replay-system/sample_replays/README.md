# Sample WC2 Replay Files

This directory contains sample replay files for testing the WC2 Replay Viewer.

## Current Status
- The WC2 Remastered game was never released
- These are sample files to demonstrate the replay system functionality
- The viewer can parse and display replay metadata and structure

## Sample Files
- `sample_replay_1.w2r` - Basic replay with minimal data
- `sample_replay_2.w2r` - Replay with player actions and game events

## How to Use
1. Place these files in the replay directory
2. Run the viewer: `cargo run --bin wc2-viewer`
3. Click "Refresh" to load the sample replays
4. Select and load a replay to see the parsed data

## Note
These are test files - real WC2 Remastered replays would contain actual game data from the (unreleased) game.
