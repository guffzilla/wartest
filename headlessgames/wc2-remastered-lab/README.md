# WC2 Remastered Headless Laboratory

**🔒 SAFETY FIRST: This project NEVER modifies your original game files!**

A comprehensive AI-driven laboratory for analyzing and creating headless versions of Warcraft II Remastered. All work is performed on isolated copies in our AI laboratory folder, ensuring your original games remain completely untouched.

## 🚨 **SAFETY GUARANTEES**

- **✅ READ-ONLY ACCESS**: Original game files are only read, never modified
- **✅ ISOLATED WORKSPACE**: All modifications happen in isolated copies within our AI laboratory
- **✅ NO ORIGINAL TOUCHING**: Your Program Files, Games folder, and original installations remain completely safe
- **✅ COPY-ONLY OPERATIONS**: We create working copies for analysis and modification
- **✅ SAFETY VALIDATION**: Built-in checks prevent accidental modification of original files

## 🎯 **Project Goals**

The WC2 Remastered Headless Laboratory is designed to:

1. **🔍 Analyze** the game's internal structure without modifying originals
2. **🏗️ Build** custom headless versions from isolated copies
3. **🤖 Integrate** AI agents for automated game testing and data extraction
4. **📊 Generate** comprehensive analytics and replay systems
5. **🔬 Research** game mechanics in a controlled laboratory environment

## 🛠️ **Current Status**

### ✅ **Completed Features**
- **Custom Game Builder**: Safely copies original files to isolated workspace
- **AI Agent Framework**: Mouse/keyboard simulation and game interaction
- **Reverse Engineering Tools**: IDA Pro, Ghidra, and analysis scripts
- **Build System**: CMake configuration for custom builds
- **Safety Validation**: Multiple layers of protection against original file modification

### 🔄 **In Development**
- **Phase 1**: Reverse engineering analysis of WC2 Remastered
- **Phase 2**: Headless modifications to isolated copies
- **Phase 3**: Custom build compilation and testing

### 📋 **Planned Features**
- **AI-Driven Game Testing**: Automated gameplay for data extraction
- **Advanced Analytics**: Victory/loss analysis and statistics
- **Replay Generation**: Custom replay system with enhanced data
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time game state tracking

## 🚀 **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**
- Rust development environment
- Warcraft II Remastered installed (for file copying only)
- Reverse engineering tools (IDA Pro, Ghidra, or x64dbg)

### **Quick Start**
1. **Set WC2 Installation Path** (for copying files only):
   ```bash
   set WC2_INSTALL_PATH="C:\Program Files (x86)\Warcraft II Remastered"
   ```

2. **Initialize Custom Game Builder**:
   ```bash
   cargo run --bin wc2-remastered-lab custom-build
   ```

3. **Run AI Agent Demo**:
   ```bash
   cargo run --bin wc2-remastered-lab ai-demo
   ```

## 🔒 **Safety Features**

### **Multiple Safety Layers**
1. **Path Validation**: Ensures custom build path is never inside original game directory
2. **Workspace Isolation**: All work confined to AI laboratory folder
3. **Copy-Only Operations**: Original files are never touched, only read
4. **Runtime Checks**: Continuous validation during execution
5. **Clear Logging**: Transparent reporting of all operations

### **What We Do**
- ✅ Read original game files for analysis
- ✅ Create isolated copies in our laboratory
- ✅ Modify only the isolated copies
- ✅ Generate analysis reports and tools
- ✅ Build custom versions from modified copies

### **What We Never Do**
- ❌ Modify original game files
- ❌ Write to Program Files directories
- ❌ Alter your original game installations
- ❌ Risk corrupting original game data

## 🧪 **Laboratory Modes**

### **1. Custom Build Mode** (`custom-build`)
- Safely copies original game files to isolated workspace
- Sets up reverse engineering environment
- Generates analysis tools and build configuration
- **SAFETY**: Only reads originals, creates isolated copies

### **2. AI Agent Demo** (`ai-demo`)
- Demonstrates AI agent capabilities
- Shows input simulation and action sequences
- No game files required for demonstration
- **SAFETY**: Completely isolated from game files

### **3. Default Laboratory** (no arguments)
- Basic laboratory functionality
- Game monitoring and analysis
- **SAFETY**: Read-only access to running games

## 🔬 **Reverse Engineering Workflow**

### **Phase 1: Analysis (Week 1)**
1. **Safe File Copying**: Copy original files to isolated workspace
2. **Tool Setup**: Prepare IDA Pro, Ghidra, and analysis scripts
